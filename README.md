$user->randomStyle()

// You may choose to use the style as a method and optionally pass in the format you want it to be in using camelCase eg(big ears Neutral)
$user->bigEarsNeutral('svg')

// or 
$user->bigEarsNeutral()

```

The avatars that are provided by the Dice Bear Api are in different file formats. The package provides a method to allow you to get the file in the format that you find most convinient.
[Supported format](https://www.dicebear.com/how-to-use/http-api/#file-format)

```php
// getting the avatar in jpeg format
$user->format('jpeg')

// The alternative way of passing the format is while using the stlyle as a method as had been shown

$user->getContent()


// You may choose to save the image locally and extract the path of the image
$user->saveImage('path/to/avatars_folders')->savedPath()


// You may only be intrested in the Url of the image
$user->url()
